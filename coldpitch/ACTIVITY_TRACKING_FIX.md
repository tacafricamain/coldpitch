# Activity Tracking & Settings Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Settings Page - "Failed to load settings"
**Root Cause:** 
- Auth was using hardcoded user ID `'1'` (string)
- Database staff table uses UUID primary keys
- Mismatch between string '1' and actual UUID caused settings queries to fail

**Solution:**
- Updated `useAuth.tsx` login function to query the actual staff member from database
- Now fetches real UUID based on email (`hello@spex.com.ng`)
- Settings page now uses real user UUID from auth context

### 2. Prospect Editing - "Save failed"
**Root Cause:**
- Same UUID mismatch issue
- When updating prospects, the user_id field expected a UUID but received string '1'
- Foreign key constraint failed

**Solution:**
- Fixed by using real UUID from database (same fix as settings)
- Now prospects are properly linked to the authenticated staff member

### 3. Activity Tracking Gaps
**Fixed Issues:**
- ✅ Login events now tracked
- ✅ Logout events now tracked  
- ✅ Adding prospects now tracked
- ✅ Editing prospects now tracked
- ✅ All activities properly attributed to the logged-in user with real UUID

**Files Modified:**
1. `src/hooks/useAuth.tsx`
   - Added Supabase import
   - Updated login() to fetch real staff member by email
   - Now uses actual UUID from database instead of mock '1'

2. `src/services/staffService.ts`
   - Removed duplicate `sendCredentialsEmail` functions
   - Removed duplicate imports
   - Added `recordLogin()` and `recordLogout()` functions

3. `src/services/supabaseProspectService.ts`
   - Added activity logging to `createProspect()`
   - Added activity logging to `updateProspect()`

4. `src/pages/Settings/Settings.tsx`
   - Now uses `useAuth()` to get real user ID
   - Uses user info from auth context instead of hardcoded values

5. `src/pages/Prospects/Prospects.tsx`
   - Passes userId and userName to prospect service functions
   - Activities now properly attributed

## How It Works Now

1. **Login Flow:**
   ```
   User enters credentials → Auth validates → Query staff table by email → 
   Get real UUID → Store in localStorage → Record login activity with UUID
   ```

2. **Prospect Operations:**
   ```
   User adds/edits prospect → Get userId from auth → Pass to service → 
   Save to database with real UUID → Log activity with details
   ```

3. **Settings Load:**
   ```
   Settings page loads → Get userId from auth context (real UUID) → 
   Query settings table → Create default if not exists → Display settings
   ```

## Testing

To verify all fixes work:
1. ✅ Login and check activity log shows "logged in" event
2. ✅ Go to Settings page - should load without errors
3. ✅ Add a new prospect - should save and show in activity log
4. ✅ Edit an existing prospect - should save and show in activity log
5. ✅ Logout - should show "logged out" in activity log
6. ✅ All activities should show correct user attribution (Spex Admin)

## Database Schema

Staff member for login (`hello@spex.com.ng`):
- Generated UUID (fetched on login)
- Name: "Admin User"
- Email: "hello@spex.com.ng"
- Role: "Admin"

All activity logs and prospect records now use this real UUID for proper relational integrity.
