## 🔐 Issue 1: Login Credentials Not Working - FIXED

### Problem
When creating a new staff member:
- Email sent successfully ✅
- Password generated ✅
- But login with those credentials failed ❌

### Root Cause
The app was creating staff **database records only**, NOT Supabase Auth users. The login system checks Supabase Auth, so credentials didn't exist there.

### Solution Implemented

**File: `src/services/staffService.ts`**

Added Supabase Auth user creation:

```typescript
async createStaff(...) {
  const password = generatePassword(12);
  
  // 1. Create Supabase Auth user FIRST
  const { data: authData, error: authError } = await supabase.auth.signUp({
    email: staffData.email!,
    password: password,
    options: {
      data: {
        name: staffData.name,
        role: staffData.role,
      }
    }
  });
  
  // 2. Use auth user ID for staff record
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('staff')
    .insert([{
      id: authUserId,  // ← Same ID as auth user
      ...staffData,
      // ...
    }])
  
  // 3. Send email with credentials
  await sendCredentialsEmail(email, password, name);
  
  return { staff: data, password };
}
```

**File: `src/hooks/useAuth.tsx`**

Updated login to use Supabase Auth:

```typescript
const login = async (email: string, password: string) => {
  // Try Supabase Auth first
  const { data: authData, error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithPassword({
    email,
    password,
  });

  if (authError) {
    // Fallback to hardcoded admin if auth fails
    if (email === MOCK_EMAIL && password === MOCK_PASSWORD) {
      // Admin login without auth
    }
    return false;
  }

  // Get staff data using auth user ID
  const { data: staffMember } = await supabase
    .from('staff')
    .select('id, name, email, role')
    .eq('id', authData.user.id)
    .single();

  setUser(staffMember);
  return true;
}
```

### How It Works Now

```
1. Admin creates staff
   ↓
2. Supabase Auth user created (auth.users table)
   ↓
3. Staff record created (staff table) with same ID
   ↓
4. Email sent with credentials
   ↓
5. Staff receives email
   ↓
6. Staff logs in with email + password
   ↓
7. Supabase Auth validates credentials ✅
   ↓
8. App fetches staff data from database ✅
   ↓
9. Login successful! 🎉

## 🗑️ Issue 2: Can't Delete Staff - FIXED

### Problem
- Click delete button
- Confirm deletion
- Nothing happens
- No error shown
- Action not logged

### Root Cause
Silent failures - errors were being caught but not logged properly.

### Solution Implemented

**File: `src/services/staffService.ts`**

Enhanced delete with comprehensive logging:

```typescript
async deleteStaff(id: string, ...) {
  console.log('🗑️ Attempting to delete staff:', id);
  
  // 1. Fetch staff info
  const { data: staffToDelete, error: fetchError } = await supabase
    .from('staff')
    .select('name, email')
    .eq('id', id)
    .single();

  if (fetchError) {
    console.error('❌ Failed to fetch staff:', fetchError);
    throw fetchError;
  }

  console.log('✅ Staff to delete:', staffToDelete);

  // 2. Log activity BEFORE deleting
  await staffService.createActivityLog({
    user_id: currentUserId,
    user_name: currentUserName,
    action: 'deleted staff member',
    entity_type: 'staff',
    entity_id: id,
    details: { 
      name: staffToDelete.name, 
      email: staffToDelete.email 
    },
  });
  console.log('✅ Activity logged');

  // 3. Delete staff record
  console.log('🗑️ Deleting staff record...');
  const { error: deleteError } = await supabase
    .from('staff')
    .delete()
    .eq('id', id);

  if (deleteError) {
    console.error('❌ Delete failed:', deleteError);
    throw deleteError;
  }

  console.log('✅ Staff record deleted');

  // 4. Try to delete auth user (optional)
  try {
    await supabase.auth.admin.deleteUser(id);
    console.log('✅ Auth user deleted');
  } catch (authErr) {
    console.warn('⚠️ Auth deletion unavailable (non-fatal)');
  }
}
```

**File: `src/pages/Staff/Staff.tsx`**

Enhanced UI error handling:

```typescript
const confirmDelete = async () => {
  if (!deletingStaff) return;

  try {
    console.log('🗑️ Delete confirmation - Staff:', deletingStaff);
    
    await staffService.deleteStaff(deletingStaff.id, ...);
    
    setStaff(staff.filter(s => s.id !== deletingStaff.id));
    success('Staff deleted', `${deletingStaff.name} has been removed`);
    
    setShowDeleteConfirm(false);
    setDeletingStaff(null);
    
    // Reload activity logs
    console.log('🔄 Reloading activity logs...');
    const logs = await staffService.getActivityLogs(undefined, 100);
    setActivityLogs(logs);
    console.log('✅ Activity logs reloaded:', logs.length);
    
  } catch (err: any) {
    const errorMessage = err?.message || 'Delete failed';
    showError('Delete failed', errorMessage);
    console.error('❌ Delete error:', err);
    console.error('Error details:', {
      message: err?.message,
      code: err?.code,
      details: err?.details,
    });
  }
};
```

### What You'll See Now

**In Console:**
```
🗑️ Attempting to delete staff: abc-123-def
✅ Staff to delete: { name: "John Doe", email: "john@example.com" }
✅ Activity logged
🗑️ Deleting staff record...
✅ Staff record deleted
✅ Auth user deleted
🔄 Reloading activity logs...
✅ Activity logs reloaded: 25 entries
```

**In UI:**
- ✅ Toast notification: "Staff deleted - John Doe has been removed"
- ✅ Staff list updates immediately
- ✅ Activity log shows "deleted staff member" entry

  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('staff')
    .update(staffData)
    .eq('id', id)
    .select()

      currentUserName
    );
    
    setStaff(staff.map(s => s.id === editingStaff.id ? updated : s));
    success('Staff updated', `${staffData.name} has been updated successfully`);
    
    // Reload activity logs
