## 🔧 Integration Notes

### Email Service Integration
Currently, the `sendBulkEmails()` function **simulates** email sending. To integrate with a real email service (SendGrid, AWS SES, etc.):

1. Update `campaignService.ts` around line 220:
```typescript
// Replace this:
console.log(`📧 Sending email to ${prospect.email}...`);
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 100));

// With actual email service call:
await emailService.send({
  to: prospect.email,
  subject: campaign.subject,
  body: campaign.body.replace('{{name}}', prospect.name)
        .replace('{{company}}', prospect.company || '')
        .replace('{{email}}', prospect.email),
});
```

2. Add your email service credentials to Settings → API Keys

### Tracking Opens/Replies
To track opens and replies:
1. Add tracking pixels to emails (for opens)
2. Set up webhook endpoints for reply monitoring
3. Update campaign stats via API when events occur
