# ⚡ QUICK FIX - Login Not Working (30 seconds)

## 🔴 The Problem

Staff members created via the app receive credentials email but **cannot login**.

## 🎯 The Root Cause

**Supabase requires email confirmation by default.**

When you create a staff member:

- BUT user must confirm email first! ❌

## ✅ The 30-Second Fix

```
https://supabase.com/dashboard
```

1. Select your **coldpitch** project
2. Click **Authentication** in left sidebar
3. Click **Settings**

### Step 2: Disable Email Confirmation (10 sec)

1. Scroll to find: **"Email Confirmations"**
2. Toggle it **OFF** (disabled)
3. Click **"Save"** at the bottom

### Step 3: Test (10 sec)

1. Create a new staff member in your app
2. Check the email you receive
3. Try logging in immediately with those credentials
4. Should work! ✅

## 🧪 How to Test Right Now

1. **Open browser console** (F12)

2. **Try to login** with the staff credentials that aren't working

3. **Check console output:**

   **If you see this:**
   ```

   🚨 EMAIL NOT CONFIRMED!
   💡 Fix: Go to Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Settings
   💡 Disable "Email Confirmations" to allow immediate login
   ```

   **Then:** Follow the 30-second fix above ⬆️

   **If you see different error:** Share the exact error message

## 📸 Visual Guide

**Where to find the setting:**

```
Supabase Dashboard
  └── Authentication (left sidebar)
       └── Settings (tab)
            └── Scroll down to "Email Confirmations"
                 └── Toggle OFF
                      └── Click Save
```

## 🔍 Alternative: Check Your Supabase URL

If you don't know your project ID:

1. Check your `.env` file:
   ```
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://xxxxx.supabase.co
   ```

2. The `xxxxx` is your project ID

3. Go to:
   ```
   https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/xxxxx/auth/url-configuration
   ```

4. Look for "Email Confirmations" toggle

## ✅ After You Disable

**What changes:**

**Before:**
- User gets 2 emails (Supabase + yours)
- Must click Supabase confirmation link
- Then can login

**After:**
- User gets 1 email (yours only)

## 🚨 For Users Already Created

If you already created staff members before disabling:

### Option 1: Manually Confirm (30 sec)
1. Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Users
2. Find the user
