### 2. Email Notification System

- Email sending function with detailed template
- SendGrid integration ready (commented out)
- Activity logging for new staff

## How It Works

### When Adding New Staff:

1. **Admin fills out form**
   - Name: John Doe
   - Email: john@example.com
   - Role: Sales Rep

2. **System generates credentials**
   - Password: e.g., "aB3$xY9#mK2Q"
   - Staff record created in database
   - Avatar generated

3. **Email sent (simulated)**
   - Console logs email content
   - In production: SendGrid sends real email
   - Professional welcome template

4. **Modal appears**
   - Shows staff name and email
   - Displays generated password
   - Copy buttons for convenience
   - Security reminder

5. **Admin actions**
   - Copy password to share manually (if needed)
   - Copy all details for documentation
   - Close modal when done

6. **Staff receives email** (when activated)
   - Welcome message
   - Login URL
   - Email address
   - Temporary password
   - Instruction to change password

## Next Steps (Optional)

### To Enable Real Emails:

   - Sign up at sendgrid.com

2. **Add API Key**
   - Create `.env` file
   - Add: `VITE_SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.xxx`

3. **Verify Sender**
   - Verify `noreply@spex.com.ng`
   - Or use your domain

4. **Uncomment Code**
   - In `staffService.ts` lines 46-62
   - Uncomment import at top

5. **Restart Server**
   - `npm run dev`

6. **Test with Real Email**
   - Add staff with your email
   - Check inbox (and spam)

### To Improve Security:

- **Password reset links** instead of emailing passwords
- **One-time passwords** for first login
- **SSO integration** (Google, Microsoft)
- **2FA requirement** for all staff
