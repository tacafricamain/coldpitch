# Staff Duty Days & Attendance Tracking - Complete! âœ…

## What Was Added

### 1. Duty Days Selection
**Location:** Staff Modal (Add/Edit Staff)

When creating or editing staff members, admins can now select which days of the week each staff member is on duty:
- Monday
- Tuesday  
- Wednesday
- Thursday
- Friday
- Saturday
- Sunday

**Features:**
- âœ… Multi-select checkboxes with visual feedback
- âœ… Selected days highlighted in primary color
- âœ… Helper text explains the feature
- âœ… Optional field (can be left empty if not tracking)

### 2. Login Attendance Tracking
**Location:** Staff Page - Staff List

Each staff member now shows their attendance status:
- **âœ“ Logged in today** (Green badge) - Staff logged in on a duty day
- **âœ— Not logged in yet** (Red badge) - Staff hasn't logged in on a duty day
- **No badge** - Either not a duty day or no duty days set

**Logic:**
- Only shows status if today is one of their duty days
- Checks if staff logged in today
- Real-time status based on login_times array

### 3. Duty Days Display
**Location:** Staff Detail Modal

When viewing a staff member's details:
- Shows all assigned duty days as badges
- Displays in primary color for easy identification
- Only shows if duty days are configured

### 4. Database Schema
**New Column:** `duty_days` (TEXT[])
- Array of day names
- Default: empty array
- Example: `['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday']`

### 5. Bug Fix: Activity Logging
**Fixed:** Delete staff activity logging

**Problem:** Activity log failed when deleting staff due to foreign key constraint
**Solution:** Log the deletion activity BEFORE deleting the staff member

## Files Modified

export interface Staff {
  // ... existing fields
  duty_days?: string[]; // NEW: Array of weekday names
}

### 3. `src/pages/Staff/Staff.tsx`

**Features:**

- Visual indicators (green = present, red = absent)

- Respects timezone

### 4. `src/services/staffService.ts`
**Fixed:**

## How It Works

### Setting Duty Days

1. **When Adding New Staff:**
   - Click "Add Staff"
   - Fill in name, email, role
   - Select duty days (checkboxes)
   - Click "Add Staff"
   - Staff created with duty days saved

2. **When Editing Existing Staff:**
   - Click edit icon on staff member
   - Modify duty days (check/uncheck)
   - Click "Update Staff"
   - Duty days updated

### Attendance Tracking

**Daily at Work:**
1. Staff member logs in
2. Login timestamp saved to `login_times` array
3. System checks if today is a duty day
4. If yes, shows "âœ“ Logged in today" badge

**If Staff Doesn't Log In:**
1. Today is a duty day
2. No login recorded for today
3. Shows "âœ— Not logged in yet" badge
4. Badge updates once they log in

**On Non-Duty Days:**
- No badge shown
- Attendance not tracked
- Staff can still log in if needed

### Viewing Duty Schedule

**In Staff List:**
- Attendance status shows current day only
- Green = Present, Red = Absent

**In Staff Details:**
- All duty days displayed as badges
- See full weekly schedule
- Easy to verify assignments

## Use Cases

### 1. Remote Team Management
```
John Doe
- Duty Days: Mon, Wed, Fri
- Today (Monday): âœ“ Logged in today
```

### 2. Part-Time Staff
```
Jane Smith
- Duty Days: Tue, Thu
- Today (Monday): (no badge - not a duty day)
```

### 3. Full-Time Staff
```
Bob Johnson
- Duty Days: Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri
- Today (Friday): âœ— Not logged in yet
```

### 4. Flexible Schedule
```

- Duty Days: (none set)
- Tracking: Not enabled
```

## Database Migration

**Run this SQL in Supabase:**

```sql
ALTER TABLE staff 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS duty_days TEXT[] DEFAULT '{}';

COMMENT ON COLUMN staff.duty_days IS 'Days of the week when staff member is on duty';
```

**Optional:** Set default duty days for existing staff:
```sql
UPDATE staff 
SET duty_days = ARRAY['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday']
WHERE duty_days = '{}' OR duty_days IS NULL;
```

## Technical Details

### Data Storage
```typescript
// Database
duty_days: ['Monday', 'Wednesday', 'Friday']

// Application
duty_days: string[] | undefined
```

### Attendance Logic
```typescript
function getAttendanceStatus(member: Staff) {
  const today = new Date().toLocaleDateString('en-US', { weekday: 'long' });
  const dutyDays = member.duty_days || [];
  
  // Not tracking if no duty days
  if (dutyDays.length === 0) return null;
  
  // Not a duty day
  if (!dutyDays.includes(today)) return null;
  
  // Check if logged in today
  const todayDate = new Date().toDateString();
  const loggedInToday = member.login_times.some(time => 
    new Date(time).toDateString() === todayDate
  );
  
  return loggedInToday ? 'present' : 'absent';
}
```

### Badge Colors
- **Present** (Green): `bg-green-100 text-green-700`
- **Absent** (Red): `bg-red-100 text-red-700`
- **Duty Day** (Primary): `bg-primary-100 text-primary-700`
