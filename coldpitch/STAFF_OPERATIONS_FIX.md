# Staff Operations Toast Error Fix

## Issue Fixed
Staff operations (create, update, delete) were succeeding in the database but showing error toasts.

## Root Cause
Same as prospect operations - activity logging was throwing errors AFTER the main operation succeeded, causing the entire promise chain to reject even though the staff member was saved/deleted.

## Solution Applied

### Files Modified: `src/services/staffService.ts`

Wrapped activity logging in try-catch blocks for all three operations:

#### 1. Create Staff
```typescript
// Before (would throw and fail the whole operation):
if (currentUserId && currentUserName) {
  await staffService.createActivityLog({ ... });
}

// After (logs warning but doesn't fail):
if (currentUserId && currentUserName) {
  try {
    await staffService.createActivityLog({ ... });
  } catch (logError) {
    console.warn('Failed to log activity (non-fatal):', logError);
  }
}
```

#### 2. Update Staff
Same pattern - wrapped activity logging in try-catch

#### 3. Delete Staff
Same pattern - wrapped activity logging in try-catch

## Result

### âœ… Create Staff:
- Staff member is created in database
- Password is generated
- Email is sent (or logged to console)
- If activity logging fails: Warning in console, but success toast shows
- If activity logging succeeds: Activity recorded + success toast shows

### âœ… Update Staff:
- Staff member is updated in database
- If activity logging fails: Warning in console, but success toast shows
- If activity logging succeeds: Activity recorded + success toast shows

### âœ… Delete Staff:
- Staff member is deleted from database
- Related data handled by CASCADE rules
- If activity logging fails: Warning in console, but success toast shows
- If activity logging succeeds: Activity recorded + success toast shows

## Testing

1. **Create a new staff member:**
   - Go to Staff page
   - Click "Add Staff Member"
   - Fill in details and save
   - Should see SUCCESS toast
   - Staff should appear in the list
   - Check console for credentials

2. **Edit a staff member:**
   - Click edit icon on any staff member
   - Make changes and save
   - Should see SUCCESS toast
   - Changes should be reflected immediately

3. **Delete a staff member:**
   - Click delete icon on any staff member
   - Confirm deletion
   - Should see SUCCESS toast
   - Staff member should disappear from list

4. **Check activity logs:**
   - View staff member's activity timeline
   - Should see all operations tracked (if activity logging succeeded)
   - If you see warnings in console about activity logging, that's OK (non-fatal)

## What Changed

### Before:
```
Staff operation â†’ Activity log fails â†’ Entire promise rejects â†’ Error toast
(But data was already saved in database!)
```

### After:
```
Staff operation succeeds â†’ Activity log attempts
â”œâ”€ If succeeds: Success toast + activity recorded
â””â”€ If fails: Success toast + warning in console (non-fatal)
```

## All Toast Errors Now Fixed! ðŸŽ‰

âœ… **Prospect create/update** - Shows correct success/error
âœ… **Staff create/update/delete** - Shows correct success/error  
âœ… **Settings load/save** - Shows correct success/error

Activity logging failures are now non-fatal warnings that don't break the user experience!
