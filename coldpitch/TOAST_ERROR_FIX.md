# Toast Error Fix - Operations Succeed But Show Error

## Issue Fixed
- Operations (save prospect, settings) were succeeding in the database
- BUT toast notifications showed "error" messages
- After page refresh, the data was actually saved correctly

## Root Cause
Activity logging was throwing errors AFTER the main operation succeeded, causing the whole promise chain to reject even though the data was saved.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Made Activity Logging Non-Fatal
**File: `src/services/supabaseProspectService.ts`**

Changed both `createProspect()` and `updateProspect()` to wrap activity logging in try-catch blocks that only warn (don't throw):

```typescript
// Before (would throw and fail the whole operation):
await staffService.createActivityLog({ ... });

// After (logs warning but doesn't fail):
try {
  await staffService.createActivityLog({ ... });
} catch (logError) {
  console.warn('Failed to log activity (non-fatal):', logError);
}
```

**Result:** If activity logging fails, the prospect still saves and user sees success message.

### 2. Fixed Settings Page Loading
**File: `src/pages/Settings/Settings.tsx`**

**Problem:** Settings tried to load before user was fetched from auth, resulting in undefined userId.

**Changes:**
- Removed fallback `|| 'admin-user-id'` from userId
- Added dependency on `userId` in useEffect
- Added guards to all functions: `if (!userId) return;`
- Settings only load when we have a valid user ID from database

```typescript
// Before:
const userId = user?.id || 'admin-user-id';
useEffect(() => { loadSettings(); }, []);

// After:
const userId = user?.id;
useEffect(() => {
  if (userId) loadSettings();
}, [userId]);
```

**Result:** Settings wait for user to be loaded, then use real UUID from database.

### 3. Enhanced Login Logging
**File: `src/hooks/useAuth.tsx`**

Added detailed console logging to track login flow:
- ‚úÖ Staff member found
- ‚úÖ Login activity recorded
- ‚ùå Errors with specific messages

**Result:** Easy to debug if login or database fetch fails.

## Testing Steps

1. **Clear browser cache and localStorage**
   - F12 ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Local Storage ‚Üí Clear All
   - F12 ‚Üí Console ‚Üí Clear

2. **Log out and log back in**
   - Use: `hello@spex.com.ng` / `spex12+++`
   - Check console for: "‚úÖ Staff member found"
   - Should see admin user with real UUID

3. **Test Settings Page**
   - Go to Settings
   - Should load without errors
   - Make changes and save
   - Should see success toast

4. **Test Prospect Operations**
   - Add a new prospect
   - Should see success toast immediately
   - Edit an existing prospect
   - Should see success toast immediately
   - Refresh page - changes should persist

5. **Check Activity Log**
   - Go to Staff page
   - Click on Admin User
   - Should see activity timeline with:
     - Login events
     - Prospect created/updated events
     - Staff operations

## What Happens Now

### Success Path:
1. User saves prospect ‚Üí Database saves ‚Üí Activity log attempts
2. If activity log succeeds: Success toast + activity recorded
3. If activity log fails: Success toast + warning in console (non-fatal)

### Error Path:
1. User saves prospect ‚Üí Database error
2. Error toast shown immediately
3. Nothing saved to database
4. No activity logged

## Known Behaviors

‚úÖ **Fixed:**
- Toast no longer shows error when operation succeeds
- Settings page loads properly with real user UUID
- Activity logging failures don't break main operations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Expected:**
- If staff table doesn't have the email, login falls back to mock user (ID: '1')
- Activity logging will show warnings in console if it fails (this is intentional)
- Settings only load after user is authenticated (small delay is normal)

## Console Messages to Expect

**Normal login:**
```
Fetching staff member from database...
‚úÖ Staff member found: {id: "uuid-here", name: "Admin User", ...}
‚úÖ Login activity recorded
```

**If database query fails:**
```
‚ùå Failed to fetch staff member from database: [error details]
Using fallback mock user
```

**If activity logging fails (non-fatal):**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Failed to log activity (non-fatal): [error details]
```

All operations should now show correct toast messages matching what actually happened! üéâ
